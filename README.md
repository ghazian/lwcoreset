Work done in this repository is for my Master's thesis titled "Comparative Lightweight Corset Construction."

## Lightweight Coreset Construction

In this paper, we will create a coresets in the context of the k-means problem. In
particular, we will discuss techniques of coreset construction such as geometric
decomposition and random sampling from the works of [[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13218-017-0519-3). The aim of the study
is to present theoretical results and to implement the techniques of building
coresets comparative to lightweight coresets which were made by the authors of
[[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08248).
